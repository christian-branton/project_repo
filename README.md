# Project Repository

This is the repository for all projects that I have completed or am in the process of completing. 

## MTA EDA Project 1

This project's main purpose was EDA focused on MTA Turnstile data for the subway. I also decided to use liquor license data from NYC.gov and check which subway stations had the most foot traffic per bars in the area around them as a way to identify a areas of high and low competition for bars.

## IMDB Votes Regression Project 2

The idea for this project was to only use linear regression and polynomial feature for IMDB votes. I used votes as a pseudo indicator of user interaction with IMDB and which genres and ratings would influence this interaction.

## World Bank Classification Project 3

When I was browsing through the World Bank Financial Inclusion dataset, I saw one of the categories being whether or not a person could come up with emergency funds and I found that to be a fascinating and informative statistic. So I based this classification project on whether or not a person could come up with emergency funds and used that to identify the differnces between features that most affect different countries andregions and how they differ.

## Tweets Stock Sentiment Project 4

The inspiration for this project was to see if there was any sort of predictive leading power in tweet sentiment and tweet count in relation to stock price. 

## Ballet Classification Neural Network Project 5

I wanted to be able to classify and recognize the differences between nuanced dance moves within a ballet video sequence. I chose to use a Hybrid CNN and LSTM RNN for this very challenging project. The uses of this kind of classification is limitless, since if you can classify the nuanced moves within a sport or activity, you can then use it to identify accuracy and strength of form using sensors training or angle detection.
